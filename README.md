# Art Station Scraper

- Do you use [artstation](https://www.artstation.com/) and want to mass download images from an artist?
- Here is your way to do so :)

## Usage
- python main.py "username"

## Requirements
- Python (3.0+)
- Chrome / Chromium browser (Replace the webdriver.Chrome path with yours if you have a different browser)
- Packages
    - BeautifulSoup
    - Selenium
    - tqdm
    - urllib

## FAQ
### Why does it open a browser?
- Because it is a dynamic site aka the content cant be accessed without actually "opening" it
### Whats the point then?
- Do you _really_ want to click a hundred times and then save images and then rename them and then also forget which one you were on and cry??? (I think not 0.0)
- IM LAZY. And I really wanted to analyze some artwork
### How can I use this?
- Download an artists art to analyze it
- Learn webscraping
- Store backups of your own work :)

## Privacy notice!!
- THIS DOES NOT DOWNLOAD THE FULL SIZE IMAGE. IT IS NOT AN ILLEGAL HACK. (All it does is automate what you would generally do manually -> go to a webpage, right click to save an image.)
- DO NOT POST THE ART YOU GOT ANYWHERE WITHOUT THE AUTHORS PERMISSION OR YOU RISK GETTING COPYRIGHTED
- I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU DO NOT HEED THIS WARNING
